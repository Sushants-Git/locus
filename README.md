## Compatibility
Locus currently supports Linux distributions running X11 only. To check your display server, run `echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE`. If the output is `x11`, Locus should work on your system. If it shows `wayland` or another type, we are working on support. Please open an issue to help us prioritize your server type.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Make sure to check the Compatibility section before proceeding.
